# Project_1

This project will consist of a web application that will compile a vacation plan for users based on the type of spender they are, and their chosen vacation destination.
It will make use of ReactJS for the frontend development, [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web APi for the RESTful API, and MySQL Workbench with defined SQL table definitions and test data for the backend.
As a result, the web application will calculate how much a user should budget before their vacation begins. The user can still adjust the vacation plan, and the calculations will update accordingly.
